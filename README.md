# Tuts
Tuts is a python based project that reads "Terms and Conditions" inputed by the user and generate a score based on how invasive the terms are for the user. 

The applicatio analyze the inputed data, find key words, and expose to the user any important information he should know.

This application is still under development and it was created during the HackWesTX Hackathon. 


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Flask
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, flash
  ```
- Rake 
```python
from multi_rake import Rake
```
## Built With

- Python
- Bootstrap 
- Love sz 

## Future Plans
Our future goal is to:
1st) Use ML in a way the program will be able to read the Terms and Conditios and choose what words represent a benefit or a danger to the customer. 
     Because of the time constraint (and a team that was learning while doing it) we wouldnt have time to develop it during the hackathon. 
2nd) Develop a Google Chrome extension to facilitate even more the user experience.
